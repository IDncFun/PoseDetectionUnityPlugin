# PoseDetectionUnityPlugin

Pose Detection For Unity Powered by MLKit Pose Detection.  Currently supported devices iOS.

## IOS 
After you have cloned the git repository locally, you can open it with Unity. The version of Unity I use is 2017.4.40, and theoretically other versions of Unity can also be opened. Switch to the iOS platform and build the xcode project. Find the Podfile file in the Unity project and put it in the root directory of the built xcode project and execute the following command.

、、、bash
pod install
、、、

This brings up an xcworkspace file and to open it, run.
